# Using Eclipse Dirigible™

Eclipse Dirigible ™ is a Cloud Development Platform providing development tools and runtime environment. It supports full development life-cycle of on-demand applications by leveraging in-system programming models and rapid application development techniques.


Eclipse Dirigible is an open source project that provides Integrated Development Environment as a Service, as well as integrated runtime execution engines. The environment itself runs directly in a browser, therefore does not require additional downloads and installations.
 The main project goal is to provide all required capabilities needed to develop and run an end-to-end development process.
