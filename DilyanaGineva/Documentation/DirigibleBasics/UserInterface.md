# Create a User Interface

In order to create a _user interface_ for your application in Dirigible you must take the following steps.

## Why do you need a user interface?

The application interface is an important part of the user experience. This is why it is important for every developer to have a nice user interface in their application.


## Requirements

1. Have a project created in the Dirigible Web IDE.

## How to create a user interface?

1.  Navigate to the **Workspace Explorer** view in the Dirigible Web IDE where your project is.
2. **Right-click** on your project. A dropdown menu appears.
3. Select **New -> User Interface**. A new dialog appears.
4. Select one of the _Template types_ from the list. Click **Next**.

  > NOTE: The user interface you choose depends on the situation, however in most cases what you will need is a _Index Page with Main Menu, Header and Footer_.

5. Write a file name for your user interface. Then choose **Next**.
6. After that, enter a title for your page. Click **Finish**.

## Where to find your user interface?

Generated User Interface files are basic _.html_ files, which will be at **Project Name -> WebContent -> Project Name** in the **Workspace Explorer** view.

> NOTE: When you choose the _Index Page with Main Menu, Header and Footer_ template, you will notice among the generated files a **main.menu** file. This file is where you select what is displayed on the navigation bar at the top of your _index.html_ page.
