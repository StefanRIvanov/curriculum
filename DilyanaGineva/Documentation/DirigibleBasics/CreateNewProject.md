# Create a Project


## Why do you need a project?

Having a project allows you to store multiple files in a single place. This is very important for the development process as it can help your project be well-structured and more organised. With Dirigible, this is a quick and simple process.

## How to create a project?

1. Navigate to the **Workspace Explorer** view of the Dirigible Web IDE.
2. Select **New > Project**. A new dialog appears.
3. Enter a project name and then choose **Next**.
4. Select a project Template from the list. Choose **Finish**.

  > NOTE: There are a handful of template options, however if you want to start without one then select the _Blank Application_ template.
