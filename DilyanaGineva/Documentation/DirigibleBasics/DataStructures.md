# Create a Data Structure


## Why do you need a data structure?

Every application needs to have a way of holding the data it manipulates and works with. This is done with data structures. We need to define the data structures that will comprise our application's data model.

## Requirements

  You must have a project created in the Dirigible Web IDE.

## How to create a data structure?

1. Navigate to the **Workspace Explorer** view in the Dirigible Web IDE where your project is.
2. Right-click on your project. A dropdown menu appears.
3. Select **New > Data Structure**. A new dialog appears.
4. Select one of the template types from the list. Choose **Next**.

  > NOTE: The template type you need depends on the situation, however in most cases what you will need is a *Relational Database Table*.

5. Define the properties your data structure will have. In the same dialog click **Add**. A new dialog appears.
6. Fill in all of the information regarding the column. After that click **OK**.
7. Add as many column definitions as you would like. Then click **Next**.
8. Write a file name for your data structure. After you are done choose **Finish**.

  > NOTE: All data structure files should end with **.table** postfix. For example: *students.table*

## Where to find your data structures?

Generated Data Structure files will be at **Project Name > DataStructures > Project Name** in the **Workspace Explorer** view.
