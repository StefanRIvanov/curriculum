# Create a User Interface

Follow these steps in order to create a user interface for your Eclipse Dirigible application.

## Prerequisites

* Have a project created in the Eclipse Dirigible Web IDE.

## Context

It's always nice when an application has a clean and responsive interface. Here's how you can create a user interface with Eclipse Dirigible.

## Procedure

1. Navigate to the **Workspace Explorer** view in the Eclipse Dirigble Web IDE where your project files reside.
2. Right-click on your project. A dropdown menu appears.
3. Select **New > User Interface**. A new dialog appears.
4. Select a template from the available list. Click **Next**.

  > *Index Page with Main Menu, Header and Footer* is the most complete template type.

5. Choose an appropriate file name for your user interface. Then choose **Next**.
6. Finally, enter a title for your page. Click **Finish**.

## Results

Your newly generated User Interface files are basic *.html* files, which will be stored at <b>*Project Name* > WebContent > *Project Name*</b> in the **Workspace Exlorer** view.

> If you elect to choose the *Index Page with Main Menu, Header and Footer* template, you'll notice among the generated files a **main.menu** file. This file is responsible for what's displayed on the navigation bar at the top of your *index.html* page.
