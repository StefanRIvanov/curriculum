4. Select a template type for your documentation. Choose **Next**.
5. Choose an appropriate file name for document. Then select **Next**.
6. Add a title for your document. Click **Finish**.

## Results

The document should open beside the **Workspace Explorer** view where you can preview it(in the **Preview** tab) and edit it.
