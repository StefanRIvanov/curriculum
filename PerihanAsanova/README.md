# Eclipse Dirigibleâ„¢

## Description


Dirigible is an open source project that provides Integrated Development Environment as a Service (IDEaaS) as well as runtime containers integration for the running applications. The environment itself runs directly in browser and therefore does not require additional downloads and installations. It packs all the needed components, which makes it self-contained and well integrated software bundle that can be deployed on any Java based Web Server.<br>
Target applications built with Dirigible are atomic yet self-contained cloud based modules that cover end-to-end vertical scenarios. These applications comply with the Dynamic Applications concepts and structure.
