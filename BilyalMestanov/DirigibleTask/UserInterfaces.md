- Existing project
- Existing table
- Existing scripting service



## Procedure

1. Open Eclipse Dirigible IDE

2. Under the `Workspace Explorer` tab locate the following file: `<Root>/Scripting Services/<Your project name>/<Your service name>.entity`

3. Right-click on the file and select `Generate > User Interface for Scripting Service`

4. Select the `List Entities` template.

5. Select all available fields.

6. Locate the `File Name` field at the bottom of the window and give your user interface file a name. Click `Next`.

7. Locate the `Page Title` field at the top of the window and type your page title.

8. Click `Finish`.




## Result

You have now successfully generated a web page that lists entries of your table.
