Project

Eclipse Dirigible is an open source project that provides Integrated Development Environment as a Service (IDEaaS), as well as integrated runtime execution engines. The applications created with Eclipse Dirigible comply with the Dynamic Applications concept and structure.

The main project goal is to provide all required capabilities needed to develop and run an end-to-end meaningful vertical scenario in the cloud for the shortest time ever.

The environment itself runs directly in a browser, therefore does not require additional downloads and installations. It packs all the needed containers, which makes it a self-contained and well-integrated software bundle that can be deployed on any Java based Web server, such as Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, etc.
