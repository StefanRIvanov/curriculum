# Create a Scripting Service
To create a scripting service for your application, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites
- Have an existing project in the [Dirigible Web IDE](http://www.dirigible.io/)
- Have atleast one defined Data Structure

## Context
In order to expose a data structure in a RESTful manner, you can create a scripting service. By doing that, you will have the ability to access and manage your data with simple API calls.

## Procedure
1. Navigate to the **Workspace Explorer**.
2. Right-click on your project. A dropdown should appear.
3. Select the **New > Scripting Service** option.
4. In the popup window, select a template from the available ones. Click **Next**.
>NOTE: You may choose **JavaScript Entity Service on Table** as it is one of the most widely used.
5. The generated **Scripting Service** must know to which table to make requests. Choose a table you want and click **Next**.
6. Choose a name for your scripting service and when done, click **Finish**.

## Results
Your new **Scripting Service** files are stored at **Project Name>ScriptingServices>Project Name** in the **Workspace Exlorer** view.
