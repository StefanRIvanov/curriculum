# Creating a Data Structure

The following steps describe the process of creating a data structure.

## Prerequisites
To achieve the results of this step you should already have a project created.

## Steps 

1. Right click on your project.
2. Navigate to **New > Data Structure**. A pop-up appears.
3. Select the desired _template_ and click **Next**.
4. Click **Add** to add a new column.
5. Fill the fields to your situation and after you are done click **OK**.
6. When you are done adding columns, click **Next** at the bottom.
7. Choose a name for your data structure. It must end with _.table_ to be working properly.
8. Right-click on your project and select **Publish**.

## Results

After you create your data structure it will live in the **Data Strucures** directory of your project. From now on, you can write queries to your data stucture. 

E.g: If you have an SQL database, navigate to **Other > Database Perspective** and type your query in the newly opened **SQL Console**
