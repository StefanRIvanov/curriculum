Exercise 2. Google for the term “cloud computing” and find at least 2 good
definitions. Based on your understanding of them, as well as on your previous
knowledge, create and put down your own definition.

Definition 1 (source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/ )
Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, 
analytics and more—over the Internet (“the cloud”). 
Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage,
similar to how you are billed for water or electricity at home.

Definition 2 (source: https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/learn-more/what-is-cloud-computing/)
Cloud computing, often referred to as simply “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing resources—everything from applications 
to data centers—over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.

My definition
Cloud computing is online delivery of hosted services. In general term is like virtual computer. 
It helps saving resources and makes work easier.
