# What is SAP Cloud Platform 

SAP Cloud Platform is an open platform as a service offering for developing cloud applications in a fully provisioned environment.

Using a set of end-to-end services, capabilities, APIs, and tools, you can build, extend, and integrate business applications in the cloud. You can also use SAP Cloud Platform to extend and integrate with existing on-premise systems (hybrid scenarios) or other cloud products.

### Scenarios 

![GitHub Logo](https://help.sap.com/doc/PRODUCTION/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/loiod5016ddf3e8b451294bcf0ad75cfda64_LowRes.png)

* Develop new cloud applications
  This scenario is suitable for companies that are developing new applications. You can create new cloud applications and reach your customers with a low learning curve and a small capital investment in software and hardware.

* Develop on-premise extensions
  This scenario is suitable for companies that have already invested heavily in an on-premise IT infrastructure. You can create new extensions to the system on the cloud, and integrate seamlessly with the on-premise components using connectivity service and cloud connector.

* Develop cloud extensions
  You can also develop extensions to other cloud products, such as SuccessFactors.
  
### Environments 
  
SAP Cloud Platform provides two different development environments: The Cloud Foundry environment and the Neo environment.

The Cloud Foundry environment is open source and based on open standards, providing choices for technologies, runtimes, and services when using SAP Cloud Platform. The Cloud Foundry environment allows great flexibility in your development process. The Cloud Foundry environment also allows for native SAP HANA development with XSA. We recommend that you use the Cloud Foundry environment to develop 12-factor and/or microservices-based applications, for services for applications using non-Java runtimes, and for IoT and machine learning scenarios.

The Neo environment is a feature-rich and easy-to-use development environment, allowing you to develop Java, SAP HANA XS, and HTML5 applications. We recommend that you use the Neo environment to develop HTML5 and complex Java applications.
For a detailed overview of the capabilities of each environment, see [Environments](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/ab512c3fbda248ab82c1c545bde19c78.html) .

### Regions 
  
The platform runs on several underlying Infrastructure as a Service technologies. Depending on the type of your global account and the development environment you're using, you can deploy applications in different regions. Regions are operated either by SAP or by third-party data center providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. For more information, see [Regions and Hosts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html).

### Services

According to your preferred development environment and your use cases, you may want to consume a set of services that are provided by SAP Cloud Platform. For more information, see [Capabilities and Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/7613d9ce711e1014839a8273b0e91070.html#loio7613d9ce711e1014839a8273b0e91070).

### Integration with SAP and Non-SAP Software

SAP Cloud Platform facilitates secure integration with on-premise systems that are running software from SAP and other vendors. Using the platform services, such as the connectivity service, applications can establish secure connections to on-premise solutions, enabling integration scenarios with your cloud-based applications.

### In-Memory Persistence

   * SAP Cloud Platform includes persistence powered by:
   * SAP HANA, taking full advantage of its real-time, in-memory computing technology and built-in analytics
   * SAP ASE, a cost-effective and high-performance transactional database, providing superior performance, reliability, and efficiency.
