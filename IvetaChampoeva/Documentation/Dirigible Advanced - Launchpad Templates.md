## Overview
After executing the following steps you will have a sample Launchpad with Items generated for your project.
## Steps
1. Create an UI for **Web Content**, from the available templates choose **Launchpad**. This is the main UI for your Launchpad.
2. Create another UI for **Web Content**, from the available templates choose **Launchpad Item**. This is the individual UI for each item in the Launchpad.
> Add as many Launchpad Items as you want
## Additional
You can make corrections to the generated UI for a Launchpad Item, by going to **ScriptingServices**. Choose the package in which the items were created. Open the **extension** folder and there you can find the generated .js files for the Launchpad Items.
