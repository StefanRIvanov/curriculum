# Eclipse Dirigible Guides
Eclipse Dirigible is a Cloud Development Platform providing development tools and runtime environment. It supports full development life-cycle of on-demand applications by leveraging in-system programming models and rapid application development techniques.
## Overview
### Purpose

</p>

Eclipse Dirigible provides capabilities for end-to-end development process from database modeling and management, through RESTful services authoring using various dynamic languages, to pattern-based user interface generation, role based security, external services integration, testing, debugging, operations, and monitoring.
### Capabilities
1. **Fast Prototyping** - Shortest turn-around time, as well as generation of predefined ready-to-use templates at any level of application development, empowers you to build a skeleton for your project directly in front of your eyes.
2. **Legacy Components** - Keeping your old methods, technologies, and computer systems is enabled by integration patterns.
3. **Adaptable Software** - Eclipse Dirigible is based on the In-System Programming Model and complies with the Dynamic Applications paradigm. You have the freedom to follow business requirements right away and apply changes as you go.
4. **Open and Free** - Eclipse Dirigible is based on a huge set of open source frameworks, such as Eclipse RAP, Mozilla Rhino, jRuby*, Groovy*, Apache Velocity, Apache Lucene, Eclipse MyLyn, and many more. The source code of the project itself is also licensed under one of the most popular licenses approved by OSI - Eclipse Public License v1.0.
5. **Shortest Dev Time** - The major benefit of such development platform is the shortest ever development turn-around time, provided by leveraging the In-System Development Model and Cloud Environment. It aims at creating end-to-end on-demand applications, as well as integrating scalable and high-available extensions of existing on-premise applications.
6. **End-to-End Coverage** - Target applications built with Eclipse Dirigible are atomic, self-contained, cloud-based modules covering end-to-end vertical scenarios. This requires the tooling, the runtime engines and the services to provide a complete set of features for all the developer needs through the whole application life-cycle.
