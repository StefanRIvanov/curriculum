##Exercise 2   
####Definitions:
1.	The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than 
a local server or a personal computer.
2.	Cloud computing is an information technology (IT) paradigm, a model for enabling ubiquitous access to shared pools of 
configurable resources (such as computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly 
provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet.

####My definition:
Cloud computing is a term for technology with which you can process and access different kinds of data on a remote 
server over the Internet.
