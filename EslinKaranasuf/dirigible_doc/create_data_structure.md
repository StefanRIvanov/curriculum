  2. __Right-click on the name__ of your project
  3. Choose __New -> Data Structure__ from the menu
  4. From the opened dialog, select the __type of the template__ you   want to use and choose __Next__
  5. Next, you'll add all necessary datastructure properties - click   __Add__ to do this
  6. In the dialog, __fill out the fields__ describing your property -   they might differ depending on the template. Click __OK__
  7. After adding all properties, __name your datastructure__   accordingly
  8. Click on __Finish__
