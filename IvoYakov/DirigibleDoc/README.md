# What is Eclipse Dirigible?

Dirigible is an [RAP](http://www.eclipse.org/rap/) based Web IDE (IDEaaS) for simple and adaptation of [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) based Web services that has evolved into a full fledged Dev Platform.
The target application archetype for Dirigible consists of database backed [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) services accessible by the end user via an [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) interface. The project’s ultimate driving force - shortest development turn-around time, requires the time between “coding” and “testing” to be zero or near to zero.
