# What is Eclipse Dirigible?

Dirigible is an RAP based Web IDE (IDEaaS) for simple and adaptation of SOAP based Web services that has evolved into a full fledged Dev Platform.
The target application archetype for Dirigible consists of database backed RESTful services accessible by the end user via an HTML5 interface. The project’s ultimate driving force - shortest development turn-around time, requires the time between “coding” and “testing” to be zero or near to zero.
