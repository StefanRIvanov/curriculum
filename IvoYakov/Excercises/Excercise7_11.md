Understanding Dirigible
========================
Here we will give you more detailed insights of how Dirigible compares to the other similar frameworks and platforms.<br/> We will explain the current focus, priorities and future vision.
1. **What is Dirigible?** <br/>
 Dirigible is an RAP based Web IDE for simple and adaptation of SOAP based Web services that has evolved into a full fledged Dev Platform.
2. **How does it operate?** <br/>
The target application archetype for Dirigible consists of database backed RESTful services accessible by the end user via an HTML5 interface.
This type of applications aim at managing the entities from a business derived domain model. 
Dirigible sticks to the “traditional” i.e. synchronous structuring of the source code and all the current Injected APIs are synchronous.
3. **Events and flows.** <br/>
In Dirigible you must declarative Flows services to achieve the non-blocking (a.k.a asynchronous) processing of the long running tasks.
The flow engine will be responsible for the distribution and parallelization of the execution of the given task.<br/>
You can code asynchronous algorithms in JavaScript by using callbacks, or any other scripting language by using its own capabilities.
4. **Dependency Management** <br/>
 Dirigible uses the “non-blocking” approach - the dependencies declarations are only to help you to navigate and pull the right components, without stopping you if a single dependency is not present at the moment.
 
5. **Supported Languages** <br/>
 The project’s ultimate driving force - shortest development turn-around time, requires the time between “coding” and “testing” to be zero or near to zero. Complex and time consuming build and deploy processes are just unacceptable. That is why Dirigible supports JavaScript as a main scripting language, but also Java as an arbitrary language.
