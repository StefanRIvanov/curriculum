This video tutorial shows viewers how Dirigible is used to create a Data Structure â€“ a Database Table in particular. It is targeted towards new dirigible users that probably are competent in web development, but don&#39;t understand how to use the Dirigible IDEaaS. Most of these users are university students and young people between 20 and 30 years old and they are keen to learn new technologies. Their main goal is to learn Dirigible as fast as possible so that they can implement it in their personal or work/university projects.

Make a guide based on this tutorial.
===================================

With the Relational databases in the Dirigible IDEaaS your project can store and modify data.

To create a database table follow these 5 steps:

### **1.** Create a new project

_By clicking on_ **Project/New** _(on the top left of the screen) and then enter a_ **Project Name.**

### **2.** Create a new Data Structure

_Right-click on your_ **Project Name** _in the heirarchy and select_ **New/Data Structure** _and from the list select_ <br />**Relation Database Table.**

### **3.** Add columns to the table

_In the lower left corner of the popup click_ **Add** _and write a name, then specify the data type of the field. <br/>Add some columns and press_ **Next** _and you will be prompted to write a name for your table._

### **4.** Add sample data to the table

_Right-click your_ **Project Name** _in the heirarchy and select_ **New/Data Structure**

_Now select_ **Delimeter Segmented Value Sample Data** _and then select the table you created from the list._

### **5.** Publish your project

_Right-click on your project name in the heirarchy and select_ **Publish.**
<br />

Now that you are done you can wirte an SQL Query to your table.<br /> On the top of the screen next to Workspace click on **other/Database Perspective**.<br /> In the **SQL Console** you can write an SQL Query to your table
